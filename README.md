# Pacman

[Course CS188 Project](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) by University of California, Berkeley.

Applied an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. Different foundational AI concepts were explored, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference
, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

### Part 1: Search
  Implemented depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

### Part 2: MultiAgent
  Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, and designed state-evaluation functions.

### Part 3: Reinforcement Learning
  Implemented value-iteration algorithm to solve Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the Pacman world. Implemented Q-Learning to allow Pacman learn from experience.
